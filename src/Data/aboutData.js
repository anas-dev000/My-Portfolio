    content: `              I began my journey as a computer science student passionate about
              solving real-world problems. Through projects like Akhtarly –
              Hardware Recommendation System and the ITI MERN Stack scholarship,
              I gained hands-on experience with backend engineering, database
              design, and modern JavaScript practices. Along the way, I built
              diverse projects—from responsive frontend with React and Angular
              to scalable APIs with Node.js and MongoDB. Today, I'm a Full Stack
              MERN developer, focused on writing clean, secure, and maintainable
              code that delivers real impact.`,
